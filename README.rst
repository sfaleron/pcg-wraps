Various `SWIG`_ bindings to the `PCG`_ suite of psuedo-random number generators. Not all features are necessarily available in a give set of bindings, and the available subset will vary from language to language. See the READMEs in each subdirectory for details.

Python bindings can be found here, and Java support is planned.
