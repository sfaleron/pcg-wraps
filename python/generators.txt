# Supported PCG variants

# The "extended" generators are not supported. There is also no support
# for custom generators with alternate permutation schemes or constants.

# The rest of the "canonical" (listed on the documentation page of the
# website: http://www.pcg-random.org/using-pcg-cpp.html) generators are
# supported. They are listed in the same order as on the website, in two
# lists, depending on whether streams are supported.

# Lines starting with hash marks are comments, and blanks are ignored.

# Blocks of lines may be commented out by preceeding with "-" on a line
# by itself, and optionally followed with a "+" to resume. If omitted,
# the rest of the file will be ignored.

# You may also buy Melissa a beer (or other libation) if you are ever
# around Harvey Mudd college.

# Cheers!
