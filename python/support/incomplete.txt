# These streams will compile if the GETSET option is set to False. This
# disables support for getting and setting generator state directly, which
# also breaks the documented interface for subclasses of random.Random, so
# it is renamed to AlmostRandom. You also may experience spurious overflow
# errors. Enable at your own risk (or fix my typemaps)!
