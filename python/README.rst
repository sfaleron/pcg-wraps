``setup.py`` is not ready yet, use ``build.py``.

``build.py`` gets the list of generators to build from ``generators.txt``, which you need to make. You can just copy ``support/mostlycomplete.txt`` to get the defaults. This file also has the documentation on how it is processed and formatted.

See ``opts.cfg`` for configuring the location of Python's header files and other such details.
